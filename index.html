              Glaucoma is a progressive eye condition marked by optic nerve
              damage due to increased intraocular pressure. It often develops
              without symptoms, earning it the moniker "the silent thief of
              sight." Early detection through regular eye exams is crucial.
              Treatment aims to reduce pressure and preserve vision with
              medications, laser therapy, or surgery. Prompt intervention is
              vital to prevent irreversible vision loss.

              Symptoms of glaucoma can vary depending on the type and stage of
              the condition. In its early stages, glaucoma often presents
              without noticeable symptoms, which is why regular eye exams are
              crucial for early detection. As the disease progresses, symptoms
              may include gradual peripheral vision loss, tunnel vision, blurred
              vision, halos around lights, eye pain, redness, nausea, and
              headaches, particularly in cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma.
              However, it's essential to note that not everyone with glaucoma
              experiences symptoms, making routine eye check-ups essential for
              timely diagnosis and treatment.

              As of now, there isn't any cure to Glaucoma. If you have glaucoma,
              it's essential to take proactive steps to manage your eye health
              and prevent further vision loss. Firstly, adhere to your treatment
              plan prescribed by your healthcare provider, which may include
              using prescribed eye drops, taking oral medications, or undergoing
              laser therapy or surgical procedures as recommended. Additionally,
              attend regular eye check-ups to monitor the progression of the
              disease and adjust treatment as needed. Be vigilant about
              controlling other health conditions such as diabetes and
              hypertension, as these can exacerbate glaucoma.
